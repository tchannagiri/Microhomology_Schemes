Hi TJ,

 

I wrote a reference sequence for the 5’ splicing delta plasmid at the below.

 

Ref seq for the 5’ splicing delta plasmid:

TGATGAACTTCGAGGACGGCGGCGTGGCGACCGTGACCCAGGACTCCTCCCTGTGGATAAATAATACCATTTGTTAGTAAAAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGGATCCTACGCGTTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATACGCGTCTAGAGTCGACCTGAGAAAAGCCTCCTTTAGTCCATATTACTGCAGGACGGCTGCTTCATCTACAAGGTGAAGTTCATCGGCGTGAACTTCC

 

Our antisense constructs have a different splicing mutant with the sense construct. We deleted the 5’ splicing site of the antisense construct instead of the branch site, which is the first 6 bp of the intron, positions 180-185 in the antisense plasmid. These 6 bp were deleted from the antisense to construct the 5’ splicing delta, so the antisense has +6 than the 5’ splicing delta. The cut positions for the 5’ splicing delta plasmid are 50-51 and 184-185. The cut positions for the antisense are 50-51 and 190-191.

 

If there is anything unclear, please let me know!

 

Thanks,

Youngkyu
